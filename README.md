# S2HD-prototype
The prototype for Sonic 2 HD [IntelOrca](https://github.com/IntelOrca) wrote in 2012 using C# / XNA, now working with Monogame.

## Requirements
I have successfully built this project with both Visual Studio 2022 and Rider 2024.1.

**Monogame** is required to build this project. You can install it nuget.

This project uses [**KENSharp**](https://github.com/sonicretro/KENSSharp).

You will also need the Sonic 2 assets, which are not included in this repository. You should put them in a 'data' folder
in the same folder as the executable.

## Building

Once you have monogame installed, the Kensharp Kosinki assembly referenced, and the Sonic data in the right place,
you should be able to just build and run.
